# Investmate Web App

## Project Description
I was given one week to build a React website which consumed an API. 

I wanted to demonstrate the tools and techniques taught during the second unit of General Assembly's Software Engineering course to show how I can build a React app with a clean and easy to navigate website. I decided to build a website that allows users to browse and research company's stock information. It also allows users to save and review their favorites so they can keep with changes with a click of a button. 

I went with this website idea because it gave me the opportunity to build a lot of different components. Everything from the nav menu drop down selector to a card carousel.
