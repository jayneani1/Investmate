#Investmate Web App

## Project title
Using React and ReactStrap, I built a stock tracking website inspired by the investing company[Stash](https://www.stashinvest.com/)

## Motivation
I wanted to demonstrate the tools and techniques taught during the second unit of General Assembly's Software Engineering course to show how I can build a React app with a clean and easy to navigate website.
